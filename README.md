# 4FrameMatingNuc
3D Printed Four (4) Frame Mini Mating Nuc

UNTESTED!! Developed over the 2016 winter, will be actually testing it in the spring/summer 2017

A 3 frame mating nuc that you can create with a 3D printer. The box, feeder tray, lid and the four frames use approx 645 grams (this will change as I make changes) (10% infill box, 20% infill all other parts) of filament. The frame size is small .. 1/3 of a normal Langstroth medium frames. With the spanners, the three frames can be taken out of the nuc and placed into a full medium Langstroth hive.

All parts are 3D printed, except one #4 x 3/8 (3mmx8) self-tapping (sheet metal, wood, cement) pan head screw to attach the entrance disk gate will be needed.

Created with OpenSCAD, you can change the size of the box, frames, etc. by changing the variables in each OpenSCAD file.

ASA filament or a high temp/low warp PLA should work best. Annealing the PLA does increase the temperature resistance of PLA but may cause shrinking. Test to find out. I'm working to anneal my PLA printed parts at 175°F (roughly 80°C). Except for ASA filament, you'll want to paint your prints to protect against UV.

**The box:** you can print the 3 or 4 frame version. 10% infill seems ok, might want to experiment with 15% infill but this will use more filament. The size of the box is larger and any mini-nuc that I'm aware of, the hope is that management needs and the chance of obsconding decrease.

**The entrance gate:** Use a screw mentioned above, the gate rotates from full open, venting only, or to the queen excluder

**The frames:** Printing the frames laying down requires supports but also creates the strongest frames. These are medium/western depth frames, using the spanners (see files), you can fit three of these in a normal hive to have the bees draw these out ahead of time.

**The feed tray:** Has a queen excluder to keep the queen away from the feed. Solid feed is better, ie: sugar, baker's fondant or candy (often times called fondant but it is not), or even pollen patties. The feed tray is optional. If you want to feed sugar syrup, then it would be best to print the top cover with a feed hole.

**The nuc cover:** Has option to be printed with a feed hole or not. With the feed hole, you can place a jar or other feeding container over the hive to feed the bees liquid feed (eg: 1:1 syrup). 

_**This project has been placed in the Public Domain**_ as a thanks to all those very open, sharing and kind beekeepers all throughout the world, the open source software developers, including those who provide CAD software and slicing software, and to those who develop open source 3d printing machines. Kudos to you all! 

I would also like to encourage additional contributors to add to the project as they desire. I'm sure there's lots of ideas out there. Additional ideas that I have is a screened bottom, and other venting as needed (I live in a very moist climate)
DO NOTE: Working on this during the 2016/2017 winter - this HAS NOT been tried or tested as of yet. THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL
This is a work in progress. The picture may not represent the latest version.
